            <p>Hello, my name is Sami Kuikka. Currently, I am doing Bachelor’s studies in <b>Computer Science</b> at Aalto university. I will graduate this year (2023) and I have planned to finish <b>Master’s programme in Web technologies</b> after that. I have also done most of the courses for the upcoming Master’s degree already in my Bachelor’s studies (70%).</p>
            <p>I got interested in the Web Development at the end of  2021. Since then, I have been focused on learning more about <b>Web Development</b> by learning new technologies and taking many Web Development courses in my studies.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to learn languages 🏫, read web novels 📖 and watch dramas 📽️.</p>
