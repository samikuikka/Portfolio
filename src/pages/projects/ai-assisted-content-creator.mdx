## About the application

The application is intended for use of game asset creators, e.g., game developers to speed up the textual asset creation.

These assets can include variety of different things, such as lore of the characters in the game or descriptions of the items in the game.

The application uses state of the art AI models (GPT-3 davinci) to generate the responses to the user requests.

We try to ease the use of these AI-models for game asset creation by automatically adding hyperparameters to the requests, saving and keeping track of previous user 
prompts and giving user option for categories which give common theme for the user prompts.

Example of the use:

Category: 
```
Wild west
```

Prompt:
```
Write a small introduction for the shopkeeper character
```

Output:
```
The shopkeeper is a grizzled old man who has seen better days. He's been running his shop in the small town for years, and he knows all the locals by name. He's always got a kind word and a helpful advice for anyone who comes into his store
```

## Own contribution

The developer group was inexperienced on web development and web development technologies, especially React in the frontend thus I have taken heavy responsibility of the frontend side of the project.

I have been part of the all the parts of the frontend side of the project, from the design to the functionalitities. I have also helped the less experienced developers to get started with the React by peer programming when problems have arised and answering frontend related questions from the team members.

This project shows my skills working in bigger projects and working with a team.
It also showcases my skills on **React** and **TypeScript**.
