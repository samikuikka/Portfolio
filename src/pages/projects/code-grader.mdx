## About the application

This project was focused on backend.

Frontend send requests containing a submission to the coding problem to the backend.

Backend puts requests in to the queue which processes them one-by-one.

Mock grading service grades the submission and the answer from the service is send back to the frontend via WebSockets.

User's submission are stored in the **PotsgeSQL** database and submission are also stored to the **Redis** cache in order to give result for the submission faster.

## Running the application

Prerequisites: Docker and docker-compose. Check out
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if you have
not them installed

    1. Create the grader docker image
        If you don't have grader-image in as Docker container then:
        1.1. Go to grader-image folder
        1.2. Build the container

```bash
  docker build -t grader-image .
```

    2. Go to folder containing the docker-compose.yml and run the docker compose
      function

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

or

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

!! If your system has containers with same names than the ones in the
docker-compose, rename the container names and start again.

3. Wait until **flyway** has loaded.

The actual website is available faster than the actual database when first
running the program. Please wait until flyway notifies you about it successfully
migrating to version 1 of database.

3. Open the application in [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) If any
   of the steps fails, please close the container instance and repeat these
   steps. If API did not start with the first try, try running
   `docker-compose up --build` again.
